# Extended pack

The file «lib/mb_lib_extend.scl» includes nice functions for modbus applications. For some station blocks this pack is required, but is it's not require by the library itself.


### swap_real
```pascal
#output := "swap_real"(#input);
```
If the data of a modbus device is stored as little endian this function can be used. TIA-portal include a function called swap(), but unfortunately wouldn't this function work when a real is a input.


### mb_delay
```pascal
#mb_client_ctrl( ... );
#mb_delay(delay := T#2s, mb_query := #mb_query);
#mb_query( ... );
```
This function will halt the execution for a certain amount of time. This useful in modbus tcp, so the client doesn't jam a network.
