# Controllers

The controllers is the part om the library that contain the modbus block from TIA-portal.

## TCP program
The following blocks can be delete if only the tcp part is used: mb_master_1200_ctrl, mb_master_1500_ctrl, mb_internal_b, mb_internal_h, mb_internal_f.
- Remember to set long enough timeout for remote networks.
- Make sure that conn_id is unique for tcp connection in the plc.

## RTU program
There are two controllers for modbus rtu, one S7-1200 and one other for S7-1500, delete the one that is not used. mb_client_ctrl can also be deleted if there is no modbus tcp.

- Even parity is default, according to the modbus specification. If for some reason this need to be change it can be done with: #mb_master_ctrl.conf.parity
- Timeout is calculated automatically according to the baud rate, but not according to telegram length and the number of repeaters. The timeout can be ajusted with: #mb_master_ctrl.conf.timeout
- For the hardware_id, use the constant in tiaportal instead writing the number of the port. This increase readability, and decrease changes of bugs. 
- When the library is imported in to a S7-1500, the mb_master_1200_ctrl generate a lot of errors, delete the block to get rid of them.
- Changing advanced parameters is possible by reache them inside the controller:
   - #mb_master_ctrl.comm_load.ICHAR_GAP
   - #mb_master_1500_ctrl.comm_load.RETRIES   
   - #mb_master_1500_ctrl.comm_load.RTS_OFF_DLY
   - #mb_master_1500_ctrl.comm_load.RTS_ON_DLY
   - And others...
