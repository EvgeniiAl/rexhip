# Controllers

The controllers is the part om the library that contain the modbus block from TIA-portal. Bellow are some notes about them.

## TCP
- Remember to set long enough timeout for remote networks.

## RTU
- Even parity is default, according to the modbus specification. If for some reason this need to be change it can be done with: #mb_master_ctrl.conf.parity
- Timeout is calculated automatically according to the baud rate, but not according to telegram length and the number of repeaters. The timeout can be ajusted with: #mb_master_ctrl.conf.timeout
- For the hardware_id, use the constant in tiaportal instead writing the number of the port. This increase readability, and decrease changes of bugs. 
- When the library is imported in to a S7-1500, the mb_master_1200_ctrl generate a lot of errors, delete the block to get rid of them.

## Deleting unsed blocks

### TCP program
The following blocks can be delete if only the tcp part is used.
- mb_master_1200_ctrl 
- mb_master_1500_ctrl 
- mb_internal_b
- mb_internal_h
- mb_internal_f

### RTU program
There are two controllers for modbus rtu, one S7-1200 and one other
for S7-1500, delete the one that is not used. mb_client_ctrl can
also be deleted.
