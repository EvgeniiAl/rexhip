## Save memory 

If a S7-1200 is used, and especially for 1211C and 1212C, then is important to save all memory possible. The library use little memory itself, but there are some trick to reduce memory usage even more.   


#### Basic
Remove RTU or TCP block that are not needed as described in «07. Controllers.md».


#### header and footer
```pascal
// mb_station_block_header( ... );

mb_query( ... );
mb_query( ... );
....

// mb_station_block_foother( ... );
```
Both mb_station_block_header and mb_station_block_foother, can be removed from each sation block. Though it will take awaye that functionality they give. Also remove the #sb udt-variable inside static section of blocks.


#### No write.

If there is no write quries in the program SERIALIZE() inside mb_query can be removed. Comment out SERIALIZE at about line 66.
