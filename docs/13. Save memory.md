## Save memory 

If a PLC with memory constrains is used then the library can be modified, to reduce it's memory need to a minimum.

#### 1. Basic
Remove RTU or TCP block that are not needed as described in «07. Controllers.md».

#### 2. header and footer
```pascal
// mb_station_block_header( ... );

mb_query( ... );
mb_query( ... );
....

// mb_station_block_foother( ... );
```
The header and foother of station blocks gives many nice features, though they are not required for the quries to execute, and hence can be reomoved. Also remove #sb-udt in the satic variable section. Note, this is only for special situations.

#### 3. Reduce quries
If a predefined station block is download, it might be that all the data is not needed. Remove the quries for that data.
