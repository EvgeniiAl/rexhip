## Save memory 

If a S7-1200 is used, and especially for 1211C and 1212C, then is important to save all memory possible. The library use little memory itself, but there are some trick to reduce memory usage even more.   

#### header and footer
```pascal
mb_station_block_header( ... );
mb_query( ... );
mb_station_block_foother( ... );
```pascal

Both mb_station_block_header and mb_station_block_foother, can be removed. Though it will take awaye some functionality.
