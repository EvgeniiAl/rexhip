## Station blocks (SB)

The library introduce a concept called station block (SB). A SB is created for one specific modbus device, containing all the queries needed to communicate with that specific modbus device. Setup modbus communication with a VFD (Variable-frequency drive) for example, usually take a day or two. The idea behind the library is that, this can be done once and the SB’s can be shared and reused in new applications. The library includes many predefined SB’s, that is freely available. New contributions to the repository is appreciated. 

A SB can plug into both modbus tcp and modbus rtu application, this is quite convenient if a rtu-tcp-gateway are going to be used. Different SB's can easily be combined in the same application, and there can be muliple instances of each SB. 

```pascal
// Every SB should start with a station header. It gives a lot extra
// functionality. #sb bellow, is a special udt that comes along with the 
// library. (mb_station_block_udt)
"mb_station_block_header"(sb := #sb, mb_query := #mb_query);

// #mb_query should be io/out-parameter on the block.

// Device address is the same for all queries, and therefore only need to 
// be defined once. #mb_addr is typically a input parameter on the block.
#mb_query.mb_addr := #mb_addr;

// Queries for each function codes are usally grouped together and the 
// function code is defined once above the queries.
#mb_query.mode := #mb_query.c.read.holding_reg,

#mb_query(data_addr := 123, data_ptr := #resault_data_query_1);
#mb_query(data_addr := 456, data_ptr := #resault_data_query_2);
#mb_query(data_addr := 789, data_ptr := #resault_data_query_3);

// Another group of queries with a different function code.
#mb_query.mode := #mb_query.c.read.input_reg,

#mb_query(data_addr := 123, data_ptr := #resault_data_query_4);
#mb_query(data_addr := 456, data_ptr := #resault_data_query_5);

// Each variable connected to data_ptr, is usally a struct equal to data 
// inside the device.

// In the buttom of each SB, after all the quries, the footer should
// be executed. 
"mb_station_block_footer"(sb := #sb, mb_query := #mb_query);

// Some features of mb_station_header and mb_station_footer
// ---------------------------------------------------------
//  - Logging capacities: Inside the station-udt there is counters for
//    successfully and failed queries, which is helpful when debugging.
//    See: "#s.log. ..."
//  - "#s.out.error" a common error flag that is set for all kind of errors.
//  - "#s.out.error_comm" a error flag that will be set after number 
//    of repeating queries resulting in communication error (timeout or 
//    bad crc). The flag configured with "#s.conf.max_repeating_comm_errors".
//  - Only one (configurable) query for each device is allowed to be executed 
//    for every loop. This will avoid one device with many queries to occupy
//    the bus for long periods of time.
//  - Handeling timeouts, so disconnected devices will not make the bus idle
//    for long periodes of time.
//  - Prevent the impact of setting if-statements around queries. The
//    "hiccup" effect.


// For this example values are set to zero if communication problems accrue.
IF #s.out.error_comm THEN
    #resault_data_query_1 := 0;   
END_IF;
