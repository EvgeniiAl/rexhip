----------

- Check the basics, that the modbus program is called from a OB, the hardware id is correct and so on.
- Try to increase timeout, especially for modbus tcp.
- Look insdie the data blcok of the SB of the device that having problem, and locate «#s.log...», see if the counters are running and lookup the error code of «#s.log.error_status», «#s.log.error_data_addr» will tell witch query generating the query. 
- Compare your application with the example.
- Locate «...mb_query.z.run.qid» (The DB), if there are more then one query in your program this variable should change value rapently.
