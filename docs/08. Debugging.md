Debugging.
----------

- Check the basics:
  - RTU: parity, buard rate, hardware id, etc.
  - TCP: IP-address and PORT, unic connection id.
- Try to increase timeout, especially for modbus tcp.
- Check datasheet of device for special requirement: function codes supported, max data length, register required to be queried together, etc.
- Compare your application with the example.
- All queries need to be quried in same order, implicates from the same OB.
- Look insdie the data blcok of the SB of the device that having problem, and locate «#s.log...», see if the counters are running and lookup the error code of «#s.log.error_status», «#s.log.error_data_addr» will tell witch query generating the query. 
- Locate «...mb_query.z.run.qid» (the DB), if there are more then one query in your program this variable should change value rapently. 
- Locate «... mb_query.z.misc.err» (the DB). Look up the error code of serialize and deserialize in tia-portal help manual. There are two explanatory resons if it differ from zero (se under). After one error is fixed, set the variable to zero, to confirm there noe more errors.
  - The data of one query includes bools, where the number dosen't add up to a whole byte, 8 bits.
  - The query length is longer then 125 words.
- Try to comment out secations of the queries and see if it solve the problem.
- cheack that there is no RETURN or something that make mb_station_block_foother not execute.
