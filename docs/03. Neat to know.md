## Neat to know

### Same memory:
If the library is only used for tcp then all blocks related to rtu can be removed to save memory. Equally all tcp blocks can be removed if the library is only used for rtu. There are two solution for rtu application one for S7-1200, mb_master_ctrl. And there is one other for S7-1500,  mb_master_1500_ctrl. Delete the block that isn't used to save memory.

### mb_query and mb_query_bits
The mb_query function only works when the number of bits adds up to whole bytes, use mb_query_bits when this is not the case.

### OB-call:
All query blocks connected and the controller need to be called in the same order for at each plc scan. If some queries or put in cyclic OB, and others in periodic interupt, then the library will not work.
