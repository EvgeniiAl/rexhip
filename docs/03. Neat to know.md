## Neat to know

### Same memory:
If the library is only used for tcp then all blocks related to rtu can be removed to save memory. Equally all tcp blocks can be removed if the library is only used for rtu. There are two solution for rtu application one for S7-1200, mb_master_ctrl. And there is one other for S7-1500,  mb_master_1500_ctrl. Delete the block that isn't used to save memory.

### mb_query:
This function only works when the number of bits adds up to whole bytes. (See also: «auto_data_len.md» and «mb_query_bits.md»)

### OB-call:
All query blocks connected to a controller has to be called in the same order for each scan, implicate they have to be called from the same OB.
