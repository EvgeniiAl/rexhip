The library extend on MB_MASTER and MB_CLIENT, the modbus blocks that comes along with TIA-portal. The library is not an attempt to reinvent the wheel, by doing what those blocks already do. Rather it's an attempt to expand the functionality of the existing blocks, and to create a common API for modbus devices.

Key features:
 - Makes it easy to split the program in to reusable interface blocks.
 - Interface blocks can easily be reused and combind in new programs.
 - A clean API, which helps to cut engineering time.
 - Reduce idle time, by skipping queries that has led to recurring timeouts before. Retries will be done ocatonally.
 - The library select queries from the interface blocks in turn, this prevent one interface block from occupying the bus for long periods of time.
 - Logging features for development and debugging.

// If modicon convention addressing is prefered, then use #mb.c.fc.modicon.read for

Requirements:
 - TIA-portal: v13, sp1, upd8 (or later)
 - S7-1200 or S7-1500. (S7-1200 firmware version >= 4.1.3)

Quick starter quide:
 - Download the latest relase. (https://github.com/olab84/TrexHippo/releases)
 - Start a new prodject in TIA-portal, and then add new PLC.
 - Localise "External Source files" in the tree structure. Inside the downloaded zip file, the following files should be imported: 
   mb_lib.scl, mb_lib.udt and mb_start_examples.scl
 - Compile once more to get rid of all the errors.
 - Continue read the "README" FC and study the start example.
